                <h2>The story so far...</h2>
                <p>
                    Humanity has reached its peak technological advancement. One of the greatest human achievements was the birth 
                    of AI. With it, they created the most sophisticated civilization to ever exist, built spaceships to brave the 
                    uncharted space, and finalized their mega-project, the Gate Network, that could carry them to the outmost 
                    fringes of the known galaxy. As it seems, there is nothing that can stop Humanity from conquering the whole 
                    galaxy. Until there is...

                <h2>And just like that...</h2>
                <p>
                    The Gate Network that connected every human colony in the whole galaxy automatically ceases to operate. As for 
                    the cause, there is neither an accountable witness nor proof that can shed light on what is known to be the 
                    cause of “The Collapse”. Colonies that were unlucky enough to colonize themselves far from the Persean Sector 
                    soon after the sudden dissolution of the Gate Network have been cut off from any communication or transport. 
                    Which causes the colony to fall into disarray and later plunge into darkness. Those who are in the Persean 
                    sector haven’t seen the worst yet.

                <h2>Post Collapse Period</h2>
                <p>
                    As the once-united colony under the Domain banner cut themselves off and created their own faction, not long 
                    after, due to the rising tension in the sector, the corporation deployed their AI war fleets to assume 
                    dominance over the Persean sector, setting the stage for the first and second AI wars. This event will last 
                    for a hundred cycles. With colonies being decimated by constant orbital bombardments, technology was lost to 
                    the fires of war, and once formidable fleets were reduced to a fraction of their initial strength. After what 
                    seems forever, a cease-fire treaty between all factions is signed, effectively ending the war. As for the 
                    technology and infrastructure lost during the war, nothing could ever bring them back.

                <p>
                    The current cycle is C+206. The scars left from the first and second AI wars still burn brightly inside the 
                    Persean sector. And the threat of another intersystem conflict lingers. You take on the role of a newly 
                    inducted space captain with your small fleets of frigates and small cargo ships. What will you become, 
                    captain? Will you become a merchant and earn your living through honest trading? Will you find the most 
                    sophisticated piece of lost technology and become the richest space captain in the whole galaxy? Live your 
                    life by marauding, raiding, and smuggling as a space pirate? Or settle in a paradise world where you create 
                    your space-conquering empire? All roads lead to Askonia, and your path will determine the shape of the whole 
                    sector. Now turn on your hyper-generator and carve your path in this lawless galaxy. May your stars shine 
                    brighter, captain.

                The game is <a href="https://fractalsoftworks.com/preorder/" class="dev-links">playable</a> on Windows, Mac, and 
                Linux. And there's no plan for a console release. Unfortunately, the game hasn’t been released on any gaming 
                platform, such as Steam or Epic Games. <a href="https://twitter.com/amosolov" class="dev-links">Alexander 
                Mosolov</a>, the game developer, stated that the game is still in Alpha state and that he only releases it when it

                there. The only acceptable payment method is through credit or debit card payment or Paypal. If you still aren’t 
                sure whether you want to buy it or not, you can find some <a href="https://fractalsoftworks.com/faq/"
